## Introduction to BDF/XDP Technology

Overview of BDF/XDP
BDF (Berkeley Packet Filter) and XDP (eXpress Data Path) are advanced networking technologies that allow for high-performance packet processing at the kernel level. XDP, in particular, enables the server to handle and filter network packets before they reach the traditional networking stack, providing an efficient mechanism to mitigate DDoS attacks and reduce server load.

Path Network Integration
[Path Network's](https://path.net) BDF/XDP technology integrates directly into the Linux kernel, enhancing the server's ability to process and filter incoming network traffic with minimal latency. Path Networkâ€™s technology is deployed in this project to provide robust DDoS protection for the VPN server, ensuring that malicious traffic is effectively filtered out.

## Prerequisites

- Access to FranTech Stallion: You'll need this to manage firewall settings and implement DDoS protection.
- A VPN Server: This will be used to whitelist protocols such as SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, and Pritunl, ensuring only authorized traffic is allowed.
- SSH Access to the Server: Secure remote access is necessary to configure and manage the server.

*Hardware Requirements*
- **Linux Server:** A Linux server (Ubuntu preferred) with:
  - **CPU:** 1 GHz or higher
  - **RAM:** 2 GB or more
  - **Disk Space:** 10 GB free space
- **Network Configuration:** Static IP address for consistent network communication.

*Software Requirements*
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later.

## Firewall Configuration

**Whitelist the following ports utilizing the FranTech Stallion Panel**

*SSH (Port 22): Used for secure remote access to the server.*

*HTTP (Port 80): Used for serving web content.*

*HTTPS (Port 443): Used for secure web traffic.*

*OpenVPN UDP (Port 22000): Used for OpenVPN UDP traffic.*

*Pritunl Web Panel (Port 31450): This port is used to access the Pritunl web panel after changing its default port. By allowing traffic on TCP port 31450, you ensure that the web interface for managing your VPN server remains accessible while using a non-default, custom port for added security.*

![Pritunl Web Panel (Port 31450): This port is used to access the Pritunl web panel after changing its default port.

*Deny All Traffic: Configure the firewall to block all traffic by default, allowing only traffic on the whitelisted ports and from the specified IP addresses.*

*Application Filter: Apply an OpenVPN UDP filter to Port 22000 to ensure only legitimate VPN traffic is allowed.*

## Pritunl Installation Steps

## 1. Update and Upgrade the System
*This step is crucial to mitigate security vulnerabilities and to ensure compatibility with the latest software packages. The -y flag automatically answers "yes" to prompts, streamlining the upgrade process.*
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y full-upgrade
````

## 2. Install Required Dependencies

*Next, install necessary utilities such as GPG and curl, which are required for adding and managing software repositories.*

````bash
sudo apt install gpg curl -y
````

## 3: System Reboot (if required)

*Some upgrades may necessitate a system reboot. Check if a reboot is required and perform it if necessary.*

````
[ -f /var/run/reboot-required ] && sudo reboot -f
````

## 4. Add Pritunl and MongoDB Repositories

*Pritunl requires MongoDB as a database backend. You'll need to add both the Pritunl and MongoDB repositories to your system.*

````
echo "deb http://repo.pritunl.com/stable/apt $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pritunl.list
````
````
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-6.0.list << EOF
````
````
deb https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs)/mongodb-org/6.0 multiverse
````
````
EOF
````
![Add Pritunl and MongoDB Repositories](https://imgur.com/CeIgcxs.png)

*These commands add Pritunl and MongoDB repositories to your APT sources list, allowing you to install the latest versions of Pritunl and MongoDB directly from their respective sources. $(lsb_release -cs) dynamically inserts your Ubuntu version code name, ensuring compatibility.*

## 5. Import GPG Keys for Package Authentication

*To ensure the integrity and authenticity of the packages you're about to install, import the necessary GPG keys for both Pritunl and MongoDB.*

````
curl -fsSL https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-6.0.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/mongodb-6.gpg
````
````
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pritunl/pgp/master/pritunl_repo_pub.asc | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/pritunl.gpg
````
![Import GPG Keys for Package Authentication](https://imgur.com/cOQRMqk.png)

*GPG keys are used to verify that the packages are signed by a trusted source and have not been tampered with. The --dearmor option converts the key to a binary format that APT can use.*

## 6. Install Pritunl and MongoDB

*With the repositories added and keys imported, you can now proceed to install Pritunl and MongoDB.*

````
sudo apt update
````
![Install Pritunl and MongoDB](https://imgur.com/9wiNZfP.png)
````
sudo apt --assume-yes install pritunl mongodb-org
````
![Install Pritunl and MongoDB](https://imgur.com/1r3NXoV.png)

*The apt update command refreshes the package lists to include the newly added repositories. The --assume-yes option automatically confirms the installation, ensuring a smooth process.*

## 7. Start and Enable Pritunl and MongoDB Services

*After installation, start the Pritunl and MongoDB services and enable them to start automatically on boot.*

````
sudo systemctl start pritunl mongod
````
````
sudo systemctl enable pritunl mongod
````

## Pritunl Database Setup

## 1. Access Pritunl Web Panel

*Open your web browser and navigate to the following URL, replacing 198.251.83.155 with your server's IP address:*
```
https://198.251.83.155/
```

## 2. Generate the Pritunl Setup Key
*Run the following command on your server*
````
sudo pritunl setup-key
````
![Generate the Pritunl Setup Key](https://imgur.com/OeuoexN.png)

## 3. Enter the Setup Key in the Web Panel

*Go back to the Pritunl web panel in your browser. When prompted, paste the setup key you copied from the server.*
