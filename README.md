# VPN-Deployment-with-BDF-XDP-Technology-by-Path-Network

This project demonstrates how to deploy a DDoS-protected VPN server utilizing BDF/XDP Technology by Path Network on a Linux Ubuntu 20.04 server. The setup includes installing the Pritunl panel, configuring robust DDoS protection using FranTech Stallion, and establishing essential firewall rules to secure network communications.

Introduction to BDF/XDP Technology
Overview of BDF/XDP
BDF (Berkeley Packet Filter) and XDP (eXpress Data Path) are advanced networking technologies that allow for high-performance packet processing at the kernel level. XDP, in particular, enables the server to handle and filter network packets before they reach the traditional networking stack, providing an efficient mechanism to mitigate DDoS attacks and reduce server load.

Path Network Integration
[Path Network's](https://path.net) BDF/XDP technology integrates directly into the Linux kernel, enhancing the server's ability to process and filter incoming network traffic with minimal latency. Path Networkâ€™s technology is deployed in this project to provide robust DDoS protection for the VPN server, ensuring that malicious traffic is effectively filtered out.

## Prerequisites

- Access to FranTech Stallion: You'll need this to manage firewall settings and implement DDoS protection.
- A VPN Server: This will be used to whitelist protocols such as SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, and Pritunl, ensuring only authorized traffic is allowed.
- SSH Access to the Server: Secure remote access is necessary to configure and manage the server.

*Hardware Requirements*
- **Linux Server:** A Linux server (Ubuntu preferred) with:
  - **CPU:** 1 GHz or higher
  - **RAM:** 2 GB or more
  - **Disk Space:** 10 GB free space
- **Network Configuration:** Static IP address for consistent network communication.

*Software Requirements*
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS or later.


## Installation Steps

### 1. Update and Upgrade the System
First, make sure your system is up-to-date.
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y full-upgrade
